### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
### General

- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type gcc main.c
- What is an entry point
- What is main
- How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- How to compile using gcc
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the main function influence the return value of the program


### Requirements
### C

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

### Shell Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`

### More Info
### Betty linter

To run the Betty linter just with command `betty <filename>`:

- Go to the Betty repository
- Clone the repo to your local machine
- cd into the Betty directory
- Install the linter with sudo ./install.sh
- `emacs` or `vi` a new file called `betty`, and copy the script below:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use betty-style
# and betty-doc separately on every item.
# Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument added by
# Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)

BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"
BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"

if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
    echo "No arguments passed."
    exit 1
fi

for argument in "$@" ; do
    echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"
done
```
- Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with `chmod a+x betty`
- Move the `betty` file into `/bin/` directory or somewhere else in your `$PATH` with `sudo mv betty /bin/`

You can now type `betty <filename>` to run the Betty linter!

***
### [0 preprocessor](0-preprocessor)

Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output should be saved in the file c

```
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ cat main.c 
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void)
{
    return (0);
}
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ export CFILE=main.c
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ ./0-preprocessor 
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ tail c
# 942 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4

# 2 "main.c" 2


# 3 "main.c"
int main(void)
{
 return (0);
}
julien@ubuntu:~/c/0x00$ 
```
